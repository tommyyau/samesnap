## Documented Contracts (from AGENTS.md & LESSONS-LEARNED)

### Message Protocol

**Client → Server (7 types):**
1. `join` - Join room with playerName
2. `set_config` - Host sets cardDifficulty/targetPlayers
3. `start_game` - Host manually starts with config
4. `match_attempt` - Player clicks symbol (symbolId, clientTimestamp)
5. `leave` - Player leaves room
6. `kick_player` - Host kicks player by ID
7. `ping` - Latency measurement

**Server → Client (17 types):**
1. `room_state` - Full state snapshot (per-player)
2. `player_joined` - New player joined (per-player for isYou)
3. `player_left` - Player removed
4. `player_disconnected` - Player lost connection
5. `player_reconnected` - Player returned
6. `config_updated` - Config changed (broadcast)
7. `countdown` - Countdown tick (broadcast)
8. `round_start` - New round with cards (per-player)
9. `round_winner` - Round won (broadcast)
10. `game_over` - Game ended with final scores (broadcast)
11. `match_result` - Match success/failure
12. `penalty` - Wrong match penalty
13. `room_expired` - Room timed out
14. `host_changed` - Host reassignment (broadcast)
15. `error` - Error with code and message
16. `pong` - Latency response
17. `you_are_host` - Notification to new host

### State Invariants (Critical)
1. Exactly ONE player has `isYou=true` per client
2. Exactly ONE player has `isHost=true` globally
3. Player counts match across all clients
4. Server is authoritative for scores (client may increment optimistically)
5. Phase transitions: WAITING → COUNTDOWN → PLAYING → ROUND_END → (PLAYING|GAME_OVER)

### Known Patterns to Check (from docs)
1. **Stale React closures** in useCallback - roomState in deps
2. **Timer cleanup** - must store handles, check phase on execution
3. **Message ordering** - countdown can arrive before room_state
4. **Synced state** - init to null, sync FROM server first
5. **Per-player broadcasts** - isYou, yourCard require iteration

## Audit Findings

### SEVERITY: HIGH

#### Finding 1: `match_result` message type unused
- **File:** `shared/protocol.ts:31`
- **Issue:** `match_result` is defined in ServerMessage but never sent by server
- **Impact:** Client may expect this message but never receives it. If client code depends on it, it's dead code.
- **Verification:** Searched `party/index.ts` - no `match_result` sends found
- **Recommendation:** Either remove from protocol or implement sending on match attempts

#### Finding 2: Penalty message uses absolute timestamp
- **File:** `party/index.ts:406-411`, `hooks/useMultiplayerGame.ts:269-273`
- **Issue:** Server sends `{ until: serverTimestamp + PENALTY_DURATION }`. Client stores this directly. If client/server clocks differ, penalty duration will be wrong.
- **Documentation:** LESSONS-LEARNED.md Bug #10 documents this exact issue but the fix wasn't applied.
- **Impact:** Penalty countdown may show incorrect values (NaN, negative, too long)
- **Verification:** `MultiplayerGame.tsx:66-78` calculates `(penaltyUntil! - Date.now())` which assumes clock sync
- **Recommendation:** Send `{ durationMs: 3000, serverTimestamp: now }` so client can compute relative duration

#### Finding 3: `nextRound` timer has no guard or cancellation
- **File:** `party/index.ts:468`
- **Issue:** `setTimeout(() => this.nextRound(winnerId), 2000)` - No handle stored, no phase guard in nextRound
- **Scenario:**
  1. Round ends, timer scheduled for 2s
  2. Player leaves at 1s mark, game ends
  3. At 2s, nextRound fires with `phase === GAME_OVER`
  4. nextRound checks winner exists but not phase
- **Impact:** Potentially corrupts state by calling `this.deck.pop()` after game over
- **Verification:** `nextRound()` at line 471 doesn't check `this.phase !== RoomPhase.PLAYING`
- **Recommendation:** Add phase guard at start of `nextRound()`: `if (this.phase !== RoomPhase.PLAYING) return;`

### SEVERITY: MEDIUM

#### Finding 4: `PlayerStatus` enum values mismatch string literals
- **File:** `shared/types.ts:35-39` vs `hooks/useMultiplayerGame.ts:189,198`
- **Issue:** Enum defines `CONNECTED = 'connected'`, but hook hardcodes `'connected' as const`
- **Impact:** If enum values ever change, hook won't update
- **Recommendation:** Import and use `PlayerStatus.CONNECTED` instead of literal strings

#### Finding 5: `handleServerMessage` useCallback deps may be incomplete
- **File:** `hooks/useMultiplayerGame.ts:119-316`
- **Issue:** `handleServerMessage` has deps `[roomCode, currentPlayerId, onError, onKicked, onRoomExpired, clearStoredPlayerId, persistPlayerId]` but references `roomState` via closure in `player_left` case.
- **Documentation:** LESSONS-LEARNED.md Bug #13 documents this, claims fix was applied using setState updater
- **Verification:** Line 166-173 does use setState updater pattern correctly
- **Status:** Previously fixed, but pattern is fragile - any new code reading roomState outside updater would break

#### Finding 6: Room timeout continues even after players join
- **File:** `party/index.ts:192-201`
- **Issue:** `startRoomTimeout()` sets 60s timer, but it's only cancelled when countdown starts (line 294-298). If players join but don't reach target, room expires even with active players.
- **Impact:** Players may be kicked with "Room timed out - not enough players joined in time" while waiting for friends
- **Verification:** `handleJoin` doesn't extend timeout when new players join
- **Recommendation:** Consider resetting timer on each join, or displaying countdown to users so they're not surprised

#### Finding 7: `game_over` handler doesn't preserve isYou flag correctly
- **File:** `hooks/useMultiplayerGame.ts:276-293`
- **Issue:** When building new players array from `finalScores`, if player not found in existing list, isYou defaults to `false`. This could happen if room_state was delayed.
- **Impact:** After game over, player may not see "(You)" marker next to their name
- **Verification:** Fallback at line 283-290 sets `isYou: false`
- **Recommendation:** Store playerId separately and match, or trust server to always include isYou

### SEVERITY: LOW

#### Finding 8: Duplicate symbol sets in codebase
- **Files:** `constants.ts:4-15` and `shared/gameLogic.ts:4-18`
- **Issue:** EMOJIS and SYMBOLS defined in both files with same values
- **Impact:** Maintenance burden, risk of drift
- **Verification:** Both files export identical arrays
- **Recommendation:** Consolidate to single source (constants.ts) and import in shared/gameLogic.ts

#### Finding 9: `RoomPhase` values are lowercase strings
- **File:** `shared/types.ts:27-33`
- **Issue:** `RoomPhase.WAITING = 'waiting'` (lowercase) but `HookSimulator` in tests uses uppercase 'WAITING'
- **Impact:** Test simulations may not match actual behavior
- **Verification:** `test-hook-state.mjs:104` uses `'COUNTDOWN'` uppercase
- **Recommendation:** Update test simulator to use actual enum values or string literals

#### Finding 10: Error handling on WebSocket.send assumes open
- **File:** `hooks/useMultiplayerGame.ts:113-117`
- **Issue:** `sendMessage` checks readyState but other direct `socket.send` calls don't
- **Impact:** Could throw if socket closes between check and send
- **Verification:** onOpen callback sends join without readyState check (line 79)
- **Recommendation:** Wrap all sends in try-catch or use sendMessage helper consistently

## Test Inventory

| Suite | File | Tests | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|-------|
| Logic | test-game-logic.mjs | 17 | Deck gen, Dobble property |
| Multiplayer | test-multiplayer.mjs | 18 | Room mgmt, game flow |
| Hook State | test-hook-state.mjs | 25 | Message handling |

| **Total** | | **~112** | |

### Test Gaps Identified
1. **No test for nextRound timer firing after game ends** - Could verify phase guard
2. **No test for clock skew on penalty** - Would require time mocking
3. **No test for room timeout with partial players** - Players joined but below target
4. **No test for match_result handling** - Message type unused anyway
5. **No test for game_over with missing player** - isYou fallback case
6. **No Playwright/browser tests running** - UI tests exist but not in npm test scripts

### Verification Commands
```bash
npm run test:logic        # 17 tests
npm run test:multiplayer  # 18 tests
npm run test:hook         # 25 tests
npm run test:stress       # 24 tests
npm run test:all          # All suites
```
